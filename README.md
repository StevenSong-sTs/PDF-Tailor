## Edge Cases to Handle:

## Project Scope
 - A Native: research into how to be cross platform as much as possible
 - Investigate build UI with Python
 - Option of using other language? C++ as I want to improve the c++ skills

**Features:**
 - Combine multiple pdf files into one
 - Split a pdf file into multiple ones
 - Import multiple PDF files -> show the preview -> Draw and drop to build different pdf outputs? (Maybe)

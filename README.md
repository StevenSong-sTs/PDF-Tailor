# PDF-Tailor
Your local tailor for merging or combining any pdfs. No more worry about the sketchy third party website steal you files

## Project Scope
 - A Native: research into how to be cross platform as much as possible
 - Investigate build UI with Python
 - Option of using other language? C++ as I want to improve the c++ skills

**Features:**
 - Combine multiple pdf files into one
 - Split a pdf file into multiple ones
 - Import multiple PDF files -> show the preview -> Draw and drop to build different pdf outputs? (Maybe) 

**Key Features of PyQt**
Rich Widget Set:

PyQt provides a comprehensive set of widgets (buttons, text fields, sliders, etc.) and layouts to create sophisticated user interfaces.
Custom widgets can also be created if the provided ones don't meet your needs.
Cross-Platform:

PyQt applications can be developed and deployed on multiple operating systems, including Windows, Linux, and macOS, without any code changes.
Signal and Slot Mechanism:

PyQt uses a unique signal and slot mechanism for event handling. Signals are emitted when something happens (e.g., a button click), and slots are functions that handle these signals. This system is powerful and flexible, allowing for decoupled event handling.
Designer Tool:

Qt Designer is a WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) editor for designing GUIs. It allows you to drag and drop widgets to create your application's interface. The designs can be converted into Python code using a tool called pyuic.
Model-View-Controller (MVC):

PyQt supports the MVC architecture, which is useful for separating the business logic from the UI. This separation makes the code more modular and maintainable.
Internationalization:

PyQt has built-in support for internationalization (i18n), which makes it easier to develop applications that support multiple languages.
Graphics and Multimedia:

PyQt provides extensive support for working with graphics (2D and 3D) and multimedia. You can easily create custom shapes, handle images, and even integrate with OpenGL for 3D graphics.
Threading and Networking:

PyQt includes modules for handling threading and networking. This makes it easier to create responsive applications that can perform tasks like downloading files or processing data in the background without freezing the UI.
Database Support:

PyQt offers integrated support for working with databases using the Qt SQL module. It supports a variety of database systems like SQLite, MySQL, and PostgreSQL, making it easy to build database-driven applications.
Licensing
GPL or Commercial License: PyQt is available under the GPL (General Public License) and a commercial license. If you plan to develop a proprietary application that you do not want to open-source, you may need to purchase a commercial license.
